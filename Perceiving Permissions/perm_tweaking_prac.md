# FUN WITH GROUPS NAMES
In this challenge I have to change permission of a file to read the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cSeUAh2cFXD2pWz9HCBSTn-2DEV.QXwEjN0wiN4EzNzEzW}`

It was mentioned in the problem statement that I have to change the permissions of the /challenge/pwn file in specific ways a few times in a row. If I get the permissions wrong, the game will reset and I can try again. If I get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let me chmod /flag to make it readable for myself.
```bash
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod uo+x /challenge/pwn

hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod g+r /challenge/pwn
You set the correct permissions!
You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ ls -l /flag
---------- 1 hacker hacker 60 Oct 10 17:19 /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ chmod u+r /flag
hacker@permissions~permission-tweaking-practice:~$ cat /flag
