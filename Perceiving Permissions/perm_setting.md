# FUN WITH GROUPS NAMES
In this challenge I have to permissions of a file to read the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sdwuv3JKIObhTW0QLP3UfSP_DyE.QXzETO0wiN4EzNzEzW}`

It was mentioned in the problem statement that I have to change the permissions of the /challenge/pwn file in specific ways a few times in a row. If I get the permissions wrong, the game will reset and I can try again. If I get the permissions right eight times in a row, the challenge will let me chmod /flag to make it readable for myself.
```bash
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u=-,g=r,o=x /challenge/pwn

You set the correct permissions!
You've solved all 8 rounds! I have changed the ownership
of the /flag file so that you can 'chmod' it. You won't be able to read
it until you make it readable with chmod!

Current permissions of "/flag": ---------
- the user doesn't have read permissions
- the user doesn't have write permissions
- the user doesn't have execute permissions
- the group doesn't have read permissions
- the group doesn't have write permissions
- the group doesn't have execute permissions
- the world doesn't have read permissions
- the world doesn't have write permissions
- the world doesn't have execute permissions
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ chmod u=r /flag
hacker@permissions~permissions-setting-practice:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{sdwuv3JKIObhTW0QLP3UfSP_DyE.QXzETO0wiN4EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Through this challenge I learnt that:
- u=rw sets read and write permissions for the user, and wipes the execute permission
- o=x sets only executable permissions for the world, wiping read and write
- a=rwx sets read, write, and executable permissions for the user, group, and world
