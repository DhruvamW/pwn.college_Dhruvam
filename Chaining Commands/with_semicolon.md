# CHAINING WITH SEMICOLONS
In this challenge I have to chain two commands to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wIae_3aO3S6g6nUy0MJj3S_tKcW.QX1UDO0wiN4EzNzEzW}`

It was mentioned in the problem statement that I have to run /challenge/pwn and then /challenge/college, chaining them with a semicolon. 
```bash
hacker@chaining~chaining-with-semicolons:~$ /challenge/pwn; /challenge/college
Yes! You chained /challenge/pwn and /challenge/college! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wIae_3aO3S6g6nUy0MJj3S_tKcW.QX1UDO0wiN4EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Through this challenge I learnt that:
-  In most contexts, ; separates commands in a similar way to how Enter separates lines.
