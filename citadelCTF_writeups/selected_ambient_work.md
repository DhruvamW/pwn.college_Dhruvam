# SELECTED AMBIENT WORK
In this challenge I have to decode a morse code to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `citadel{1_L0V3_1DM}`

- Upon opening the WAV file, a few seconds into the music, Morse code starts playing and it plays throughout the rest of the audio.
- The morse code was too long but on seeking forward a bit in the track we could see the starting of the flag by citadel{ }.
- Upon decoding the morse code inside the brackets I got the flag.

## What I learned
Through this challenge I learnt that:
-  you can view a .wav file in an audio viewer that will separate the sounds based on frequencies.
