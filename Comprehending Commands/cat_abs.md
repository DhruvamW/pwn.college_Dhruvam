# THE ROOT
In this challenge I have to read the flag from a file using cat.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sWYSpa90HnT6skCc-ufouEezTLn.QX5ETO0wiN4EzNzEzW}`

It was mentioned in the problem statement that I have to read the 'flag' file  with 'cat' command and the path to 'flag' as an argument to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@commands~catting-absolute-paths:~$ cat /flag
pwn.college{sWYSpa90HnT6skCc-ufouEezTLn.QX5ETO0wiN4EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Through this challenge I learnt that 'cat' command is most often used for reading out files. '/flag' is where the flag always lives in pwn.college, but unlike in this challenge, I typically can't access that file directly.
