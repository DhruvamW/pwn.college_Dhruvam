In this challenge I have to run a command with an argument as given in the doumentation.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{I9WY0FJaOEOrc1YmfwkgkMq7iXM.QX0ITO0wiN4EzNzEzW}`

It was mentioned in the problem statement that I have to read the documentation to understand what to do. The documentation of this problem stated that I have to ivoke the '/challenge/challenge' command with '--giveflag' argument to get the flag.
```bash
hacker@man~learning-from-documentation:~$ /challenge/challenge --giveflag
Correct argument! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{I9WY0FJaOEOrc1YmfwkgkMq7iXM.QX0ITO0wiN4EzNzEzW}
```
