# INTRO TO ARGUMENTS
In this challenge I have to pass my first command with arguments.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Qhjj6PCQtFXSbcxVb0FdudBLY0j.QX4YjM1wiN4EzNzEzW}`

I understood that When you type a line of text and hit enter, the shell actually parses your input into a command and its arguments. The first word is the command, and the subsequent words are arguments.

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Qhjj6PCQtFXSbcxVb0FdudBLY0j.QX4YjM1wiN4EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
In this challenge I learnt about the echo command. "echo" is a command that prints all of its arguments back into the terminal.
