# INTRO TO COMMANDS
In this challenge, I have to invoke my first command.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Mc2NraN65VPB0wZzXxp2xxCBD3b.QX3YjM1wiN4EzNzEzW}`

For this challenge , I understood that "hacker@dojo:~$" is a prompt where I have to enter a command. The $ at the end of the prompt tells that I am not the adminstrator but a normal user. The "hacker" in the prompt is the name of the current user. The "dojo" part of the prompt is the hostname of the machine the shell is on. 

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Mc2NraN65VPB0wZzXxp2xxCBD3b.QX3YjM1wiN4EzNzEzW}

```

## What I learned
Through this challenge I was able to invoke the "hello" command after a prompt was given to me by the shell. By invoking the command I was able to generate a flag. I also learnt that the commands in Linux are case-sensitive.
