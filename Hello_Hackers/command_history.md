# COMMAND HISTORY
In this challenge I have to scroll throught the commands I have previously used.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kLNeoC48Sz9wOu6OO3NJiNpr5EF.0lNzEzNxwiN4EzNzEzW}`

I hit the up arrow  on my keyboard and the flag was displayed there.

```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{kLNeoC48Sz9wOu6OO3NJiNpr5EF.0lNzEzNxwiN4EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Through this challenge I learnt that the shell saves a history of every command I invoke. I can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys. So if I need to run a similar command again, I can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it.
