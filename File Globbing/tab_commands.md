# TAB COMPLETION ON COMMANDS
In this challenge I have to tab-complete my command to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{cPLLy6YSej8r8Am1DTt2uf83BVK.0VN0EzNxwiN4EzNzEzW}`

It was mentioned in the problem statement that I have to tab-complete a command  that starts with pwncollege. 
```bash
acker@globbing~tab-completion-on-commands:~$ pwncollege-5354 
Correct! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{cPLLy6YSej8r8Am1DTt2uf83BVK.0VN0EzNxwiN4EzNzEzW}
