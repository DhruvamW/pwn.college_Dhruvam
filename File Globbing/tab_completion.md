# TAB COMPLETION
In this challenge I have to tab-complete my command to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sWlXriGuLIJtU5-Wgag605ah-A2.0FN0EzNxwiN4EzNzEzW}`

It was mentioned in the problem statement that I have to cat the file /challenge/pwncollege using tab-completion. 
```bash
hacker@globbing~tab-completion:~$ cat /challenge/pwncollegeâ€‹ 
pwn.college{sWlXriGuLIJtU5-Wgag605ah-A2.0FN0EzNxwiN4EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Through this challenge I learnt that if we hit tab in the shell, it'll try to figure out what we're going to type and automatically complete it.
