# THE ROOT
In this challenge I have to type a file path to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y0wcZcvIaKCA8gp-MbNWeK3WMKi.QX4cTO0wiN4EzNzEzW}`

It was mentioned in the problem statement that a program called 'pwn' has already been inserted in the root directory which is referenced by '/'. On typing the path to 'pwn' the flag got generated.

```bash
hacker@paths~the-root:~$ /pwn
BOOM!!!
Here is your flag:
pwn.college{Y0wcZcvIaKCA8gp-MbNWeK3WMKi.QX4cTO0wiN4EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
Through this challenge I learnt about the root diectory in linux. I learnt that files in our computers are stored in directories and not randomly arranged.
