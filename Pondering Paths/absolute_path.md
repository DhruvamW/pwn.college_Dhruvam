# THE ROOT
In this challenge I have to type a file path to get the flag.

## My solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{sdwMsbwBW0yXjM_AnKLcokcqrP0.QX1QTN0wiN4EzNzEzW}`

It was mentioned in the problem statement that challenges in pwn.college are in the challenge directory. The name of the program to be executed for this challenge was 'run'. So the absolute path to that file would be: /challenge/run

```bash
hacker@paths~program-and-absolute-paths:~$ /challenge/run
Correct!!!
/challenge/run is an absolute path! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{sdwMsbwBW0yXjM_AnKLcokcqrP0.QX1QTN0wiN4EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned
I learnt about Absolute Path Referencing.
